This straightforward Flask application makes it simple to publish a picture gallery that is located in a directory.
To sort photos, use the unix modification time, putting the most recent at the top.


To install dependencies--
 $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Note: The images must be in a directory pointed by GALLERY_ROOT_DIR settings.

'''Used flask to create a basic web page where one can upload/publish images contained in a directory.'''
